# Day1-GuessingGame

## Project Overview

This is a C# console application implementing a number guessing game. The game challenges the user to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 10 within a maximum of 4 attempts. It is developed using .NET 10.0.

The game provides feedback to the user after each guess, indicating whether their guess was "too low" or "too high." The game concludes when the user correctly guesses the number or runs out of attempts.
